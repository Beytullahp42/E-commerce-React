Note: Since the Spring Boot backend of this app is hosted on a Render free plan, it goes to sleep after periods of inactivity. As a result, the initial boot-up can take up to 50 seconds to 1 minute.
Additionally, since I don‚Äôt have persistent disk storage allocated, uploaded images may be deleted on each redeployment.
